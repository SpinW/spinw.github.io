title: Horace and SpinW Workshop 2019
subtitle: Joint workshop on SpinW and INS data analysis

This will be a training course on how to get the most out of the Horace and SpinW software packages. Horace is a widely used suite of Matlab programs for the visualisation and analysis of large datasets from time-of-flight neutron inelastic scattering spectrometers. SpinW is a Matlab library that can plot and numerically simulate magnetic structures and excitations of a given spin Hamiltonian using classical Monte Carlo simulation and linear spin wave theory. ​
​

The course will be split into two parts, with 2 days spent on Horace and 2.5 days spent on SpinW. Participants may attend either or both of the two workshops. The course will be free to attend but participants must cover the cost of their travel and accommodation.
## Dates

* *Horace:* 10am Monday 21st - 6pm Tuesday 22nd January 2019
* *SpinW:* 10am Wednesday 23rd - 3pm Friday 25th January 2019

## Place

The workshop will be held at the [ISIS neutron source](http://www.isis.stfc.ac.uk/people/directions-to-isis6523.html), Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, U.K. Accommodation is available (and booked) for all participants at the on-site [Ridgeway House](http://www.stfc.ac.uk/about-us/where-we-work/rutherford-appleton-laboratory/ridgeway-house/) guesthouse. Participants must cover their own transportation and accommodation costs  - rooms are at the discounted rate of £60 per night (including all meals).​

## Topics

### SpinW
   
   * Introduction to magnetic structures and linear spin wave theory
   * Internal data structure of SpinW and advanced data manipulations
   * Handling complex magnetic structures
   * Symmetry analysis
   * Finding the right magnetic ground state
   * Fitting inelastic neutron scattering data (powder, single crystal)

### Horace

* Planning an experiment
* Visualising data
* Performing corrections on your data
* Data treatment (symmetrisation, etc)
* Fitting
* Resolution convolution
* "Ask the expert" session at the end, to allow you to discuss specific issues with the developers

## Requirements

It is expected that participants will have encountered SpinW in their work already. It is imperative that participants are familiar with Matlab. A working knowledge of Matlab is expected, and the courses will not be beneficial without this. Bringing a laptop is not necessary as we will provide a Windows PC to everybody. However you can also bring your own laptop if you have Matlab (R2012a or later) preinstalled.


##  Registration

Please use [this google form to register](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdcp7oqe5VxwGny09kjrSFcCBSNS-WjOfWXkmNq0RHU9WItUw/viewform?usp=sf_link)​​. 

On the registration site you will be asked about your reasons for attending the course(s) - in the event of oversubscription we will use these answers to determine places. Priority will be given to PhD students whose thesis work will make use of these codes, and to scientists who are planning or have already done time-of-flight inelastic neutron scattering experiments

##  Deadline

The closing date for applications is **9am Monday 10th December 2018**

We are looking forward to see you in Didcot!
