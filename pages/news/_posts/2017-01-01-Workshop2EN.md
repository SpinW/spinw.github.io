We are happy to announce the next combined workshop on SpinW and Horace at ISIS in Didcot, UK. The 5 days workshop will be split into two parts, with 2 days course on Horace followed by 2.5 days on SpinW. Participants may attend either or both of the two workshops.

## Dates

* *Horace:* 30th January 1st February 2017%BR%
* *SpinW:* 1st February 3rd February 2017

## Place

The workshop will be held at the [ISIS neutron source](http://www.isis.stfc.ac.uk/people/directions-to-isis6523.html), Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, U.K. Accommodation is available (and booked) for all participants at the on-site [Ridgeway House](http://www.stfc.ac.uk/about-us/where-we-work/rutherford-appleton-laboratory/ridgeway-house/) guesthouse. Participants must cover their own transportation and accommodation costs.

## Topics

### SpinW
   
   * Introduction to magnetic structures and linear spin wave theory
   * Internal data structure of SpinW and advanced data manipulations
   * Handling complex magnetic structures
   * Symmetry analysis
   * Finding the right magnetic ground state
   * Fitting inelastic neutron scattering data (powder, single crystal)
   * New features

Our aim is that at the end of the 2.5 days course, all participants will be able to fit a measured spin wave spectrum and magnetic structure using a model spin Hamiltonian. All topics except the introduction will include hands on practical and there will be time at the end of the course for discussing specific issues with the developer.

### Horace

Details of the Horace Workshop can be found [here](http://horace.isis.rl.ac.uk/Horace_Workshop).

## Requirements

It is expected that participants will have encountered SpinW in their work already. It is imperative that participants are familiar with Matlab. A working knowledge of Matlab is expected, and the courses will not be beneficial without this. Bringing a laptop is not necessary as we will provide a Windows PC to everybody. However you can also bring your own laptop if you have Matlab (R2012a or later) preinstalled.


##  Registration

*The course is free.* Please register [Here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfusm3MO4vuRF4NYEWVzpOTZocuTsSuZBi2XD0LSyQCaSHcew/viewform?usp=send_form). Participation is limited to 20 places for both courses. On the registration site you will be asked about your reasons for attending the course(s) - in the event of oversubscription we will use these answers to determine places. Priority will be given to PhD students whose thesis work will make use of these codes and to scientists who have experimental data that they plan to model with SpinW.

##  Deadline

12:00 GMT on Friday 23rd December 2016


We are looking forward to see you in Didcot!
